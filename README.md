## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation and service workers both aid the functionality of the application. Graceful degradation starts with the highest level of functionality and features, then gets reduced while keeping the applciaiton working. Service workers allow web applications to funciton offline or under poor network connections. This allows for essential parts of the application to continue to be accessible even when there is no network, causing this to be a form of graceful degradation that adapted for features that relied on network.
